# Analysis-of-Airbnb-in-Boston
Brief investigation for Airbnb in Boston All of our visualiztion for Airbnb boston is conducted in 3 aspects, the price, review and the conditions of the residence there. This project includes 2 folders named "Data" and "ScreenShot" additional with an R markdown notebook "AirbnbBoston.Rmd". "Data" covers all the original datasets we use from Kuggle (compact in "datasets" including 3 seperate charts) and a csv file "locationinfo" which we use to save our zipcodes and neigborhoods information. When you run the codes, you can directly read this csv file instead of running the loop to get the location information with ggmap. "ScreenShot" folder contains all the results output in our codes arranged corresponding to the order of our codes. the markdown notebook "AirbnbBoston.Rmd" covers all of our codes with necessary instructions beside. Thank you for reviewing this file and our project.
